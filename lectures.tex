%\chapter{Mechanical Energy}

\example{Kinetic energy of an airplane: with a mass of 68,000 kg (Airbus-A320). (This is the maximum mass the aircraft is allowed to take off with.) Flight time from Boston to New York is 30 minutes and the distance is 210 miles= 340km. Therefore, its kinetic energy is 
\be
\frac12 mv^2 = 0.5\times 6.8\times 10^4 \times \left(\frac{3.4\times 10^5}{30\times60} \right)^2 J.\ee
Doing the multiplication leads to 1.2GJ. 

There is also the potential energy $mgh$. Assuming the plane flies at 30,000 ft (9000m), this potential energy is about 500 MJ.
\be
V = 6.8\times 10^4\times 9.8\times 9000J = 6GJ\ee
about 5 times the kinetic energy. So the total energy required is over 7 GJ (neglecting air resistance).
The number of passengers on the plane is about 150. Dividing that up leads to 50 MJ per passenger.
}

Analyze the energetics of a car trip from Boston to New York. Since the distance is 210 miles and considering a car that gets 30 miles per gallon, the trip requires 7 gallons of gas. 

\conversion{1 Gallon = 3.78 Liters = 3780 cm$^3$}

The density of gas is  0.85 g/cm$^3$. So a gallon of gas has about 3200 gms. The molecule $C_6H_{14}$ has a molar mass of about $6*12+14=86$ gm/mol. So, there is about 37 moles in a gallon of gas. If we estimate the energy per mol as 100 kcal/mol, we get 3700kcal/gallon = 15 MJ/gallon, which is too low by a factor of 8. Perhaps because there are 6 carbon atoms in the molecule, the binding energy is about 800 kcal/mol. The total energy per gallon of gas is 120MJ.

Seven gallons of gas therefore contain 840MJ of energy. However, transforming that energy into usable energy is not 100\% efficient. It is roughly 25\% efficient, so buying 7 gallons of gas gives you about 210MJ of energy. How is that used to get from Boston to New York?

\bei
\item {\bf Kinetic Energy} First calculate the difference between the kinetic energy of the car moving at 60mph and the car at rest (0). The energy in the gas must be used to give the car this kinetic energy, equal to 0.65 MJ. This is assuming no stops. Even assuming 20 stops, though, leads to only {\bf 13 MJ}, far smaller than the 210 we are trying to account for. 
\item {\bf Potential Energy:} Going up a hill, the car gains potential energy $mgh$ and then loses it going down. The energy per mile gained and lost is 270kJ assuming an average hill height of 15m per mile. To ensure not going too slow or too fast, though, the driver will either have to provide more gas or more break to keep a stable speed. A rough estimate is that half of that 270kJ gets consumed, so the total energy used over the 210 miles is roughly {\bf 28 MJ}.
\item {\bf Air Resistance:} Toy model has each air molecule picking up the velocity of the car, so the total kinetic energy transferred to the air (and therefore lost by the car) equal to $dMv^2/2$ where $dM$ is the mass in an infinitesmal volume $dV = Adx$ where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the car. So, after traveling a total distance $D$, the energy lost to air friction is
\be
\Delta E \sim \frac12 \rho A D v^2
.\ee 
The twiddle here reflects the fact that this is an approximation, rectified by inserting a fudge factor, $c_d$, the drag coefficient, which is of order 1/3 for cars. Putting in $c_d$, and taking $A=2.7$m$^2; \rho=1.2$kg/m$^3$ (for air) leads to an energy loss of {\bf 130 MJ}.
\item {\bf Friction:} The energy lost to friction of the tires with the road is estimated in the text to be {\bf 50 MJ}.
\eei
The total estimate is therefore about 220 MJ, which is roughly correct.

\example{Air resistance of airplane: take the width of the Airbus-A320 to be 3.7m, so that the cross-sectional area is $\pi\times 1.5^2m^2=11m^2$; the speed of a short flight to be again 200m/s (450 mi/hour). For the density, use the fact that
\be
\rho = \rho_0e^{-z/H}\ee
with $H=8.5$km.
Then, the density of air at 30,000 ft is about 1/3 of its ground value so
\be
\Delta E = c_d 0.5\times 0.4kg/m^3 \times 11\times 3.4e5 m^3\times 200^2 m^2/s^2=30c_dGJ
.\ee
The good news is that airplanes are designed to have \href{https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Aircraft-Drag-Polar-Estimation-Based-on-a-Model-Sun-Hoekstra/38ee841fa4dcc353a0ce2345cdc6e7d498b14a4e/figure/15}{very small drag coefficients, less than about 0.04}. So, the energy lost to air resistance does seem to be sub-dominant to that due to kinetic and potential energy. Note though that these losses increase with distance, so a flight ten times longer might need to account for them.}

\lecture{Rotational Energy}

Point mass rotating in a circle 
\bee
\item 
\be\vec r= R(\sin\omega t,\cos\omega t)\ee
so $|\vec r|=R$, a constant.
\item
\be\vec v = \omega R\,\left(\cos\omega t, -\sin\omega t\right)\ee
so $|\vec v| = \omega R$, a constant. Therefore,
\be
E = \frac12 mR^2\omega^2\ee
\item 
\be\vec a=-\omega^2 R(\sin\omega t,\cos\omega t) = -\omega^2 \vec r\ee
again with constant amplitude $\omega^2R$ and direction pointing inwards.
\item Newton's second Law requires a force
\be
\vec F = -m\omega^2 \vec r\ee
to keep the particle in circular motion.
\item Centrifugal force: In a rotating system, the mass feels a force
\be
\vec F_{\rm centrifugal} = m\omega^2 \vec r.\ee
\example{Particle on surface of the Earth experiences a forces of magnitude $m\omega_\Earth^2 r$ where $r$ is the distance to the axis of rotation, equal to $R_\Earth\cos\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the latitude, equal to zero at the equator. The acceleration due to this force is
\be
\omega_\Earth^2  R_\Earth\cos\lambda = 
0.034\cos\lambda\,m\,s^{-2}\ee
taking the radius of the Earth to be 6400km and the rotation frequency to be $2\pi/24$ hours. So, this is a few hundred times to a thousand times smaller than the acceleration due to gravity. Note that this force points from the surface of the Earth to the axis of rotation, so it is possible to decompose it into a vertical force (akin to gravity) and a horizontal component. E.g., in the Northern hemisphere it would be pointing Southward.}
\item The angular momentum of this is simple to calculate:
\be
\vec L = \vec r \times \vec p = - mR^2 \omega\hat z \ee
as expected from the right-hand rule, pointing along the downwards $\hat z$-axis. It is natural to define the direction of the angular frequency to be with that same right-handed rule, here along $-\hat z$. Therefore,
\be
\vec L =mR^2\vec \omega
\ee
\item Generalize for multiple particles:
\be \vec L = I\vec \omega\ee
and $E=I\omega^2/2$. The moment of inertia is defined as
\be
I \equiv \sum_i m_ir_i^2 \rightarrow \int d^3x \rho(\vec x) \left( x^2+y^2\right)\ee
when the relevant axis is the $z$-axis. I.e., the distance squared is the perpendicular distance to the axis, the shortest line connecting a point mass to the axis.
\example{$CO_2$ molecule: The carbon atom is at the center and the 2 oxygens at the ends of a roughly linear configuration. The moment of inertia is roughly
\be
I=2m_{O} R^2\ee
so its energy is equal to $L^2/2I$ or
\be
E = \hbar^2 \frac{(L/\hbar)^2}{4 m_O R^2}
\ee
where $\hbar=1.05\times 10^{-34}$ J-s. Taking the mass of oxygen to be 16 times the proton mass and the distance between the oxygen and carbon to be the typical atomic value of an angstrom leads to 
\be
E = \frac{L^2}{\hbar^2} \,4.12\times 10^{-23}\, J
\ee}
\eee
Note that $(\vec v=\vec r\times \vec\omega)$.

\example{Energy in wind circulation system: Consider a parcel of air with $10^\circ$ radius at $40^\circ$ latitude over the Pacific Ocean up to 1 km above. Its' {\it zonal} (east-west) wind speed is about 20m/s. Let's calculate its rotational energy. Taking the density to be constant and all roughly the same distance from the axis of rotation, its moments of inertia is
\bea
I &=& \rho V R_\Earth^2\cos^2\phi\vs
&=&\left[ R_\Earth^2\cos^2\phi\right]\, \left[ 1{\rm km}\times \pi R_\Earth^2 (0.177)^2 \right]
\rho \eea
since ten degrees is equal to 0.177 in radians. To get the energy we multiply this by $\omega^2/2=(v/r)^2/2$ so the first term in brackets cancels, and we're left with
$E=8\times 10^{17}$J. This is not quite the right metric for wind power because the cross-sectional area here is huge, but it gives some sense of how much energy is available in wind.

\lecture{Energy Usage}

\item
Annual World Energy Use in EJ is 562.1 EJ ($10^{18}$J)
\item
Global Power Use is 17.82 TW ($10^{12}$W)
\item 
Global Energy Consumption is then 156138 TW-hours $=562$ EJ
\item
Daily Energy Use per capita is 200 MJ
\eei

There is some data \href{https://github.com/owid/co2-data}{here}.

\Spng{world_energy_co2}{$CO_2$ emissions from all countries in the world plotted alongside all countries' energy use multiplied by intensity, 20 gm/MJ.}
One interesting number from \href{https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh0687}{here} (dashed line in first figure there) is that the amount of $CO_2$ emitted per energy for oil and gas is 69 grams per MJ. This is called the GHG intensity. Note that this is the weight of $CO_2$ and (a perennial problems is to convert) the corresponding weight of carbon is 12/44=0.272, so the intensity of carbon is about 20 grams per MJ. Multiplying by the annual use above leads to 
\be
562\times 10^{18} J \times 20 g/MJ \simeq 10^{13} kg
\ee
of carbon emitted in $CO_2$ every year. One metric tonne is 1000kg, so this does indeed correspond to the well-known 10Gt of carbon emitted every year.
Fig.~\rf{world_energy_co2} shows that the energy consumed by the world multiplied by this intensity does indeed roughly track the actual $CO_2$ emissions.

Note that this value of the intensity makes sense: roughly speaking, the orbital energy of electrons is shuffled during the reactions that produce $CO_2$. That means the typical energy gained is say 5 eV per molecule of $CO_2$. Therefore, to produce 5 eV requires $12\times 1.67\times 10^{-24}$gm, or roughly $2\times10^{-23}$gm. But 5 ev$=8\times 10^{-19}$J. So, one gm of carbon is required to produce 40kJ. To produce 1 MJ requires 25 gm of carbon, which pretty close to the observed intensity.

The intensity can be computed for each country. Fig.~\rf{intensity18} shows that countries with more advanced economies (higher GDP/capita) tend to have lower intensities. They are generally moving to energy production that produces less $CO_2$ emissions. 
\Spng{intensity18}{Intensity (the ratio of $CO_2$ emissions and energy consumed for some of the countries in the world in 2018.}

Fig.~\rf{intensity_country} shows the evolution for several different countries. Brazil is interesting: most of their electricity comes from hydropower. France generates quite a bit of power from nuclear energy. Frustratingly, the US has not appreciably have reduced its intensity over the past 50 years. China has been making slow but steady progress as it modernizes, while India is on a reverse trajectory, similar to many other developing countries.

\lecture{Heat and Thermal Energy}
\lsection{Equipartition Theorem}
The kinetic energy of a system of $N$ particles is equal to
\be
\langle E \rangle = \int d^3v f(\vec v)\,\frac{mv^2}{2}
\ee
Here $f(v)$ is the velocity distribution normalized so that
\be
N = \int d^3v f(v)
.\ee
In equilibrium, $f\propto e^{-E/k_BT} = e^{-mv^2/2k_BT}$, so normalization leads to
\bea
N &=& C4\pi\int_0^\infty dv v^2 e^{-mv^2/2k_BT}
\vs 
&=& C4\pi \left(\frac{2k_BT}{m} \right)^{3/2}\int_0^\infty dx x^2 e^{-x^2}
\vs
&=&
C4\pi \left(\frac{2k_BT}{m} \right)^{3/2}\,\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}4
\vs
&=&
C \left(\frac{2\pi k_BT}{m} \right)^{3/2}.
\eea
So,
\be
f=N \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{3/2}\, e^{-mv^2/2k_BT}.\ee

We can now calculate the kinetic energy:
\bea
\langle E \rangle &=& N \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{3/2}\,  \int d^3v e^{-mv^2/2k_BT}\,\frac{mv^2}{2}
\vs &=& 2\pi Nm \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{3/2}\, \int_0^\infty dv v^4 e^{-mv^2/2k_BT} \vs
&=&
2\pi Nm \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{3/2}\, \left( \frac{2k_BT}{m}\right)^{5/2}\,\int_0^\infty dx x^4 e^{-x^2} 
\vs
&=&
2\pi Nm \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{3/2}\, \left( \frac{2k_BT}{m}\right)^{5/2}\, \frac{3\sqrt{\pi}}{8}
\vs
&=&
\frac{3Nk_BT}{2}.
\eea
If we had done this in 1D, we would have gotten $k_BT/2$. In general, the variance of any one component of the velocity is $k_BT/m$, so in an isotropic equilibrium situation, there is a factor of 3. 

The situation is more complex for more complex particles, starting with diatomic atoms. There, the book says you add $k_BT/2$ for each degree of freedom. 
\comment{Redo this for a diatomic molecule at temperatures in the atmosphere, presumably only rotational degrees of freedom excited. Work out the energy.}

Similarly for solids, the idea is there is no random kinetic energy but rather the $N$ atoms can each oscillate in one of 3 dimensions and each of these modes leads to $k_BT$ because there is a kinetic and potential term. It is really a bit more complicated: the energy of a harmonic oscillator is
\be
E_n=\hbar \omega\left(n+\frac12 \right).\qquad n=0,1,2,\ldots\ee
Again, the probability of a single one of these oscillators begin in the $n$th state is proportional to $e^{-E_n/k_BT}$. Now the expected energy is
\be
\langle E\rangle
= N\frac{\sum_n E_n e^{-E_n/k_BT}}{\sum_n e^{-E_n/k_BT}}
\ee
or
\be
\langle E\rangle = -N\frac{\partial}{\partial\beta} \,\ln Z
\ee
where $\beta\equiv 1/k_BT$ and
\be
Z\equiv \sum_ne^{-E_n/k_BT}=\frac{e^{-\hbar\omega\beta/2}}{1-e^{-\hbar\omega\beta}}.\ee
So,
\be
\langle E\rangle = N\left( \frac{\hbar\omega}{2} + \frac{\hbar\omega}{e^{\hbar\omega\beta}-1} \right).\eql{bare}\ee
The first term is the zero-point energy and the second term is the energy due to thermal excitations.

The low temperature limit of this $\hbar\omega \gg k_BT$ means that only the $n=0$ term will contribute and $Z=e^{-E_0\beta}$, leading to
\be
\langle E\rangle = NE_0\ee
all the particles in the ground state. The other limit is the high temperature limit, in which case \be
\langle E\rangle_{hi\, T} =Nk_BT\ee
The book explains this as the harmonic oscillator having kinetic and potential energy, each of which contributes $k_BT/2$.

You can go through the same exercise for any degrees of freedom: rotational or the energy levels in an atom. You do not always get $k_BT/2$ for each degree of freedom, but the probability of finding a particle in a given energy state is always proportional to $e^{-E/k_BT}$ when the system is in equilibrium.

More generally, it will be useful to calculate the expected number of particles in a given state with energy $\hbar\omega$. Putting aside the ground state energy in \ec{bare}, the second term can be thought of as the total number of particles times the mean energy per particle. But the mean energy per particle is the mean number of particles in a state with energy $\hbar\omega$ times that energy. So, the mean number of particles in a state with energy $\hbar\omega$ is
\be
f(\omega) = \frac{1}{e^{\hbar\omega/k_BT}-1}.\ee
This turns out to be the Bose-Einstein occupation number.



\example{5.1: Heating one mole of the monatomic gas argon from 300 to 600K requires 
\be
E = \frac32 R\Delta T=3.7kJ\ee
with $R=8.3J/mol/K$. This is one percent of the atmosphere, which has a total mass of $5.15\times 10^{18}$ kg; suppose that Argon was 1\% in volume of this (it is actually 1\% in mass, but there shouldn't be too much difference). Now 1 mole of Argon weighs 40 gms, so the total amount of moles of argon in the atmosphere is $1.29\times 10^{18}$. Therefore, heating the argon in the atmosphere by 1K would require  16 EJ. That is about 3\% of annual global energy use. So presumably, adding in the rest of the atmosphere would push the energy past the annual global usage.}



\lsection{Pressure and Efficiency}

Thermal energy can be converted into mechanical energy.  E.g., thermal motion from a gas exerts a force on a piston. In one dimension,
\bei
\item Each particle that hits the wall has its energy remain the same (so $|v|$ is constant) but it changes direction. Therefore, the change in momentum in a given bounce off the wall is $2mv$. 
\item The particle will then move in the other direction towards the fixed wall in a time $l/v$, and then return to the piston in the same time. So in a total time $2l/v$, the momentum that the particle gives to the piston is $2mv$. 
\item The force is then 
\be F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{mv^2}{l}
\ee
\item The total force from $N$ particles drawn from a thermal distribution is
\be
F = \frac{Nm\langle v^2\rangle}{l} = \frac{Nk_BT}{l}
\ee
\item The pressure is the force per area, so
\be
PV = Nk_BT.
\ee
\eei
This is the ideal gas law.

\example{Consider Example 5.2 in the book. (see notebook chapter5)
\bei
\item What is the initial internal energy? (150 J)
\item How much work is done to reduce the volume by a factor of 2? (50 J)
\item What is the new temperature? ($4T_i/3=364K$)
\item What is the pressure right after compression? ($8P_i/3=2.67\times 10^5$Pa)
\eei
}

If the region outside the piston is a vacuum such that its pressure is zero, then the work done on the piston pushing it a distance $dx$ is
\be
dW = Fdx=PAdx.\ee
On the other hand, in the more realistic case that the region outside has a pressure smaller by only a smaller amount $\Delta P$ (if, e.g., the inner region is slightly heated), then the force is only $\Delta P A$. So, the efficiency -- the fraction of work done related to maximum possible is
\be
\eta = \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{T_{in}-T_{out}}{T_{in}}
\ee
where the second equality holds in the case of an ideal gas.

The internal energy of the gas in the inner region is reduced by the work it does, by an amount $PdV$ (some of this work serves to heat the gas on the other side of the piston, not just move the piston). But, it can also gain internal energy if it is heated so the total change in its internal energy is
\be
dU = dQ - PdV.\ee

When heat is added ($dQ>0$), then temperature will rise, so that $dQ=CdT$. If the volume is fixed (the piston does not move in the above example, then all the heat will go into increasing the temperature, so the temperature should rise more than if the piston moved (and the pressure remained constant because the density went down). We distinguish therefore between two heat capacities:
\bea
C_V&\equiv& \frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\Big\vert_V
\vs
C_P&\equiv& \frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\Big\vert_P + P\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\Big\vert_P.
\eea

We have already computed $U$ for an ideal monatomic and diatomic gas. 
\bei
\item Monatomic: $C_V = (3/2) Nk_B$
\item Note that using the ideal gas law, a gas has $C_P=(5/2)Nk_B$
\item Diatomic (high $T$): $C_V=(7/2) N k_B$ because of the 2 vibrational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom.
\eei

\example{An 8-minute shower contains a volume of water equal to $9.5\times8$ liters.
The specific heat of water is 4.18 kJ/(kg*K) from Table 5.2, while the density of water is
997 $kg/m^3$. Therefore, the energy required is
\be
Q= c_p\times\rho\times V\times \Delta T.\ee
Therefore, the energy needed to heat an 8 minute shower is 9.5MJ. This is 5\% of the average daily per capita use.}

Note that the specific heat of water is quite high. If we write
\be
c_p = \frac{N_D k_B}{2m_{H_2O}}\ee
which corresponds to $0.23 N_D$ kJ/kg/K, or 18 degrees of freedom. \href{http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/304/h2o.pdf}{Section 5 here} explains that this can be understood if we treat water as a solid. In general, there are 6 degrees of freedom for a monatomic atom in a solid, so multiply this by the 3 atoms to get 18. 

\comment{This could also draw on the calculation in 8.7.3 and replace/supplement the one above.}
 
 \example{In a fission reactor, helium is a good substance to carry the heat from the center of the reactor, where it is hottest to the outside where it is transformed into electricity. The helium comes to the turbines at a temperature of 1000$^\circ$C and -- after imparting its energy to the turbines -- drops to 100$^\circ$C. If each helium atom makes the trip once every 5 minutes, how much helium is required to generate 100 MW of electricity? Note that the efficiency of turning the thermal energy into electricity is 40\%, so the amount of thermal power required is 250MWth (for 100MWe).

The heat added to the turbines by a mass $m$ is 
\be
c_p m\Delta T = 5.2\times 900\,\frac{m}{kg}\, kJ.\ee
For this to be equal to $250MW$, we require 
\be
\frac{5.2\times 900kJ}{300 s} \,\frac{m}{kg} = 2.5\times 10^8J/s.\ee
This corresponds to a mass of about $1.6\times 10^4$ kg.

Check the value of $c_P=C_P/m=(5/2) N k_B/ m$ since $c_P$ is the specific heat capacity, which is per mass. Now $m/N$ is the total mass divided by the total number of particles, which is just the mass of a single helium atom, $4\times 1.67\times 10^{-27}$kg. Therefore, 
\be
c_P=\frac{2.5\times 1.38\times 10^{-23} J/K}{4\times 1.67\times 10^{-27} kg},\ee which is indeed 5.2 kJ/K/kg.

Definitions:
\bei
\item Heat flux $\vec q$: energy flowing per time per area
\item Rate of energy across a surface S: \be\frac{dU}{dt} + \int_S d\vec S\cdot \vec q = 0\eql{cont}\ee This is a form of the continuity equation: the change in time in the internal energy in a region is equal to the flux of energy through the surface bounding that region.
\eei

\lsection{Conduction}
This is simply particles in regions with larger velocity dispersions leaking into regions with lower dispersions and visa versa.

Fourier's Law: \be \vec q(\vec x) = -k\nabla T(\vec x)
.\ee
$k$ has dimensions of $E/(T\times K)$. Air has $k=0.026$ W/mK, while window glass has $k=1$ W/mK, meaning that more energy is required to heat up a region on the other side of glass than if there were no glass partition.

\example{Large uniform area with two ends at temperatures $T_0$ and $T_1$, it is a 1D problem:
\be
q=-k\frac{dT}{dx}
\ee
If this is, for example, air flow through a wall or window, the heat coming in equal the heat coming out, so $dU/dt=0$ and applying Gauss's Law to the right hand side of \ec{cont} leads to
\be
\nabla\cdot \vec q = 0 \rightarrow \frac{dq}{dx}=0
,\ee i.e., $q$ is constant. The relevant differential equation is then
\be
T = T_0 - x\frac{q}{k}
.\ee
Setting $T=T_1$ at $x=L$ leads to
\be
T_1-T_0= -qL/k \eql{fourier}\ee
or
\be
q=k \frac{T_0-T_1}{L}
.\ee
For example, for glass, with $k=1$ W/mK; and the temperature inside $T_0=293$ and the temperature outside $T_1=273$ (freezing) and a window of thickness 5mm, we find $q=4$kW/m$^2$. The larger the thickness of the window the less heat is lost; that makes sense. And similarly the greater the temperature different, the more heat is lost. If the thermal conductivity is large, then again more heat is lost. The final expression for the temperature gradient is
\be
T=T_0 - x \frac{T_0-T_1}{L}.\ee
Finally, if the area of the window is 1m$^2$, then a total of 4 kW is lost. So over 24 hours, you might think about 100 kW hours are required to provide the heat that accounts for this one window. In fact, the amount is much smaller than this.}

Combine the impact of different materials in series leads to:
\be
q=\frac{\Delta T}{R_{tot}}\ee
with
\be
R_{total} = \sum_i \frac{L_i}{k_i}
.\ee
\example{In the example above, what was neglected was the boundary layer on either side of the window. The window itself contributes $R_w=0.005$ m$^2$K/W, but $R_{inside}=0.12$ m$^2$K/W and $R_{outside}=0.03$ m$^2$K/W, so $R_{tot}=0.16$ m$^2$K/W. This gets the loss down to 3kW-hours per day.}

In the above example, we can also estimate the temperature on the inside and outside of the window. Since air has $k=1$ in these units, 
\bea
L_i &=&0.12 m\vs
L_0 &=& 0.03 m
\eea
Since the temperature follows the simple solution of \ec{fourier}, the temperature on the inside of the window
satisfies
\be
T_0-T_i=\frac{qL_i}{k} = 0.12 q \frac{m^2K}{W}
.\ee
But, in this case,
\be
q= \frac{20}{.16} W/m^2
= 125 W/m^2
\ee
so, the temperature right at the inner surface of the window is 15K cooler than in the rest of the room.

\example{Example 6.2 is a realistic estimate of how much heat it takes to warm an entire house $20^\circ$ C. 
The average house size in the US is about 2000 square feet, call it $14\times 14$ m$^2$ for simplicity. This means the walls have an area of $14\times 3*2 + 14*3*2=168$ sq. ft (if the height is 3m) and the ceiling has area 196 m$^2$ for a total area emitting heat (apart from the ground) of about 365 m$^2$. 
\bei
\item First suppose a 20cm concrete wall with $k=0.9$ W/mK. This corresponds to $R=L/k=.22$ Km$^2$/W, or a heat flow of $q=\Delta T/R = 91 W/m^2$. Over the entire surface area of the house, this would require heating of 45kW.
\eei
}
To put this in context, over the course of one year, the energy required to heat this one house would be $1.4$ GJ. Assuming there are close to 100 million single family houses in the US, that leads to 140EJ, which itself would be 1/3 of the world's energy consumption. There are problems with the estimate: $\Delta T$ is not $20^\circ$C at all times and in all places, but it is clearly way too high. 

A more sophisticated insulation system reduces the heat loss by a factor of 20 (see next example), but this is still about 1 EJ, compared with 500 EJ for all humanity, so this is a fairly large chunk of energy.

\example{Use instead 20 cm ($8''$) of fiberglass with $R=4.6$ Km$^2$/W. This increase R by a factor of 20 and effectively solves the problem. Note the typo (0.3 instead of 0.03) in Example 6.2.}

\lsection{Convection}

Consider a small volume element in gravity with density and pressure as shown in Fig.~\rf{convection} (asterisks), compared to that outside. The question is: is it stable to a small perturbation $dr$ upwards? The net force on a stable volume element vanishes; it is equal to 
\be
\Delta F_{net}= -\Delta P A - g\rho A\Delta z
\ee
where the first sign is negative because pressure that decreases with height corresponds to negative $\Delta P$, which leads to an upward force. In equilibrium, these two forces vanish so
\be
\frac{dP}{dz} = -g\rho
.\ee
The question is: if you move a volume element up a bit, will its density be greater than or less than the ambient density at the new height? (The ambient stuff is in equilibrium.). You might think it would be greater than because it comes from a region where the density was larger, but the volume expands as it it raised so the density goes down. We need a way then of determining the new density of this slightly perturbed volume element.

\homework{Consider a perfectly elastic ball of mass $m$ bouncing up and down on a horizontal surface under the influence of gravity. Prove that averaged over time, the downward force of the ball on the floor is equal to $mg$. Generalize that to show that the pressure of air on the surface of the Earth is equal to $\int dz \rho g$.}


If yes, then it will not move and the system will be stable; if not, then there is an instability that manifests itself as convection. At its new location, it will expand adiabatically until its pressure is equal to the ambient pressure: $P_2^*=P_2$. In its initial position, the density and pressure were equal to that of the surrounding atmosphere. So, the only thing that changed is the density, and the equation of state says that density scales with pressure as $\rho\propto P^{1/\gamma}$, we have
\bea
\rho_2^* &=& \rho_1^*\,\left(\frac{P_2^*}{P_1^*}\right)^{1/\gamma}
\vs
&=&
 \rho_1\,\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/\gamma}\eea
 since the pressures inside and outside are equal, as are the initial densities before the perturbation.

\Sjpg{convection}{A small volume element displaced upwards will experience a restoring force due to gravity if $\rho_2^*>\rho_2$. That is the stability condition; if not satisfied, then there will be convective transport.}

Now perturb:
\be\rho_2=\rho+\rho' dr
\ee
so
\be
\rho_2^*= \rho \,\left(\frac{P+P'dr}{P}\right)^{1/\gamma}\ee
So, the density inequality becomes
\be
\rho \,\left(\frac{P+P'dr}{P}\right)^{1/\gamma}> \rho + \rho' dr\ee
Expanding the term in parentheses leads to
\be
\frac{P'}{\gamma P} > \frac{\rho'}{\rho}.
\ee
If this is satisfied, then the system is in convective equilibrium.

In the case of the ideal gas law: $\rho= \frac{mP}{k_BT}$, so
\be
\rho' = \frac{mP'}{k_BT} - \frac{mPT'}{k_BT^2}
.\ee
Plugging in leads to:
\be
-\left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)\, \frac{T}{P}\, \frac{dP}{dr} > -\frac{dT}{dr}\eql{conveq}
\ee
The left hand side is called the adiabatic lapse rate or temperature gradient. Both left and right sides are positive because pressure and temperature decrease as you go up.
So, this equation says that there is no instability, no convection, if the temperature gradient (absolute value) is smaller than the adiabatic value. If it is larger, then the cool air rises.

There is another way to do this: apply the first law:
\be
dQ=0 = dU+dW=c_vdT + PdV=c_vdT-\frac{Pd\rho V}{\rho}\ee
where the last equality follows from $\rho\propto V^{-1}$.
Then, for an ideal gas,
\be
dP = \frac{d\rho k_BT}{m} + \frac{\rho k_B dT}{m} 
=   \frac{c_v\rho dT k_BT}{mPV} + \frac{\rho k_B dT}{m} 
\ee
Consolidating leads to
\be
dP = dT \frac{\rho k_B}{m}\left[ 
\frac{c_vT}{PV} + 1
 \right] \ee
 But $PV/T = Nk_B=c_p-c_V$, so the term in brackets is $\gamma/(\gamma-1)$, and the equilibrium condition becomes
\ec{conveq}.

We can actually solve this to find what is called the {\it potential temperature}, the temperature that would be obtained if a parcel moved from one pressure to another. Writing the equation as
\be
\frac{dP}{P} = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}\,\frac{dT}{T}
\ee
and then integrating leads to
\be
P = P_0 \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)}.\ee
Identifying $T_0$ with $\theta$, the potential temperature, and then inverting leads to 
\be
\theta = T\,\left( \frac{P_0}{P} \right)^{1-1/\gamma}
\ee
For dry air, $\gamma=1.4$, so the exponent is 0.286. This potential temperature is what is plotted in atmospheric sounding plots. Fig.~\rf{sounding} shows both lines of constant temperature and potential temperature. The thick curves, which at the surface are around 20K, are the actual temperatures. If the temperature at a given height is higher than the potential temperature

\Sfig{sounding}{Plot showing the variation of temperature and pressure with altitude. Red lines denote constant temperature; blue thin lines are the potential temperature.}

\lsection{Radiative Transfer}

Derive Stefan-Boltzmann law:
\bee
\item Start with a sphere of radius $R$ containing photons of a given energy $E$ corresponding to momentum $pc$. 
\item Suppose these are uniformly distributed with density $f(E)$  (similar to distribution of velocities for particles), so that each box in phase space with volume $d^3r d^3p = h^3$ has this number of photons in it
\item At any point in the surface, the energy leaving the volume per time is
\be
 \frac{dQ}{dt} _r = \frac{dQ}{dR}\,\frac{dR}{dt} =  \vec p \cdot \hat r f(\vec p) cR^2 d\Omega d^3p \,\times c 
\ee
where the extra factor of $c$ is the velocity.
\item The total energy carried by these photons with this energy passing through the surface is\footnote{This is not quite right because any value of $\theta<\pi/2$ does not escape, but that factor of 2 is compensated because there are two spin degrees of freedom for the photon.}
\be
 d^3p f(\vec p)pc^2R^2\int_0^\pi d\theta \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi  \cos\theta = d^3p 2\pi R^2  f(\vec p)pc
 \ee
 \item Now sum over all momentum: in a given small region of space and momentum, the {\it volume} of the phase space is $(2\pi \hbar)^3$. So instead of summing, when integrating, this leads to
 \be
  \frac{dQ}{dt}  = \frac{Ac^2}{2} \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi\hbar)^3}\, f(\vec p)p
 \ee
 \item Putting in the Bose-Einstein distribution leads to
 \be
  \frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{Ac^2}{4\pi^2\hbar^3}\, \int_0^\infty \frac{dp\,p^3}{e^{pc/k_BT} - 1}.\ee
 \item Changing variables to $x=pc/k_BT$ leads to 
 \be
  \frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{A(k_BT)^4}{4\pi^2\hbar^3c^2}\, \int_0^\infty \frac{dx\,x^3}{e^{x} - 1}
  .\ee
  \item The integral is just a number $\pi^4/15$, so the flux is
  \be
   \frac{dQ}{dt}  = \frac{A\pi^2(k_BT)^4}{60\hbar^3c^2} = A\sigma T^4
  \ee
  where the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is defined as
  \be
  \sigma \equiv \frac{\pi^2k_B^4}{60\hbar^3c^2} = 5.67\times 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2\, K^4}.\ee
\eee


\lsection{Time Dependent Conduction}

Applying Gauss's Law to \ec{cont} leads to
\be
\frac{\partial u(\vec x, t)}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot \vec q.\ee
The time dependence is captured in the temperature dependence, and $dy/dT = \rho c_V$, so
\be
\rho c_V \dot T + \nabla\cdot \vec q = 0.\ee
But then, there is Fourier's Law that $\vec q = -k \nabla T$, so
\be
\dot T - a\nabla^2 T=0,\ee
with the thermal diffusivity $a$ defined as
\be
a \equiv \frac{k}{\rho c_V} .\ee

Fourier modes: Consider a simple Fourier mode, $T(\vec k) = T_k(t) e^{i\vec k \cdot \vec x}$ (this is a different $k$ than the heat conductivity; take the real part at the end). Then, the heat equation becomes,
\be
\dot T + ak^2 T = 0.\ee
The dimensions are right since $a$ has dimensions of $L^2/T$ and $k$ has dimensions of $L^{-1}$. Solving this lead to
\be
T_k(t) = T_0 + T_k(0) e^{-ak^2t}\ee
where a constant value can be added, so really this is the sum of two plane waves, one with infinite wavelength. This generalizes to
\be
T(\vec x,t) = \sum_{\vec k} T_k e^{-i\vec k\cdot\vec x} e^{-ak^2t}.\eql{genheat}\ee
So, in general, oscillations with wavelength $2\pi/k$ decay away on a time scale of order $1/k^2a$. The long wavelength oscillations take a longer time to decay. Similarly, a material with large diffusivity will come to equilibrium in very short times.

Some examples, in units of $mm^2/s$:
\bee
\item Carbon: $a=217$
\item Glass: 0.34
\item Brick: 0.52
\item Soil: 0.24
\eee
So, a temperature difference across a pane of glass 10 mm thick will decay away in about 10 seconds, while it would take decay in only a fraction of that time.

\lsection{Ground Temperature Seasonal Variation}
Use the fact that
\be T(z=0,t) = T_0 + \Delta T \sin(\omega t)
\ee
with $\Omega \equiv 2\pi/1$ year to determine the full solution as a function of depth below the soil (positive $z$). Focusing on the time-dependent part and decomposing into Fourier modes, we get
\be
i\omega T_\omega - a T''_\omega=0.\ee
This has an exponential solution with $T_\omega \propto e^{\lambda z}$, with $\lambda$ a complex number satisfying
\be
i\omega - a\lambda^2 = 0.\ee
Also, the real part of $\lambda$ must be negative so that the oscillations go away as you go deeper into the ground. The solution to this is
\be
\lambda = -\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{a}}\, e^{i\pi/4} = - \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2a}}\, (1+i)
\ee
where the phase follows from $i^{1/2}$. The minus sign out front ensures that the real part is negative. We therefore have
\be
T(t,z) = C e^{i[\omega t- cz]}\,e^{-cz}
\ee
with
\be
c\equiv \sqrt{\omega/2a}\ee

For soil, with $a=0.24$ mm$^2$/s, the length scale $c^{-1}= 1.6$m.

\item Light comprised of photons with energy

E = \frac{\hbar c}{\lambda}
.\ee
\item Discrete energy levels: $E_n$. For atomos and molecules there are 3 scales, with electronic shells typically having $E_n\propto \epsilon/n^2$ in the 1-10 eV ($1.6\times 10^{-18}-10^{-19}$ J) range; vibrational levels have $E_n\propto \epsilon n$ with energies in the 0.1 eV ($10^{-20}$) range; and rotational levels scaling as $l(l+1)$ with energies several orders of magnitude lower than vibrational levels.
\example{We estimated earlier that for $CO_2$,
\be
E_{l}^{\rm rot} = l(l+1) \,4.12\times 10^{-23}\, J\eql{co2rot}
\ee}
\item Photons absorbed means atomic/molecular transition from one state to another, with 
\be
E_\gamma = E_2-E_1
.\ee
\example{Given the levels in \ec{co2rot}, we can calculate the energies of photons that will be absorbed. For example, the $l=0\rightarrow l=1$ transition is mediated by a photon with energy
\be
E_\gamma = 8.24\times 10^{-23} J\ee
corresponding to a wavelength of 
\be
\lambda = \frac{\hbar c}{E_\gamma} = 127 \,{\rm microns}.\ee
But, what is most interesting is the shift of the vibrational lines. Consider the photon that induces a transition from one vibrational level to another with the main line at 15$\mu$ (corresponding to an energy of $E_0=1.32\times 10^{-20}$J. There will be a variety of lines around this one corresponding to rotational shift from $l\rightarrow l-1$, with an energy shift of $lE_\gamma=0.006 l E_0$, so the fractional shift is the wavelength will be $0.006l$ J. Fig.~\rf{CO2-lines-detail} shows this structure around the 15 micron line. Note that this is at room temperature, so $k_BT\simeq 300$K, which means the ambient energy is of order $4.8\times 10^{-21}$J, which in turn means that rotational states up to $l=10$ should be occupied. Thus, we expect shifts as large as 6\% or 40cm$^{-1}$ on the plot. This is not what is seen, presumably because the rotations here are around a different axis of rotation?

\lsection{Fission}

Reaction rates are determined by cross-sections. For the reaction $B+T\rightarrow C$, the rate at which $C$ particles are produced is equal to
\be
\frac{dN_C}{dt} = \Phi_B \sigma_{BT\rightarrow C} \ee
where $\Phi_B$ is the flux, the number of particles per unit area per time. 

Fission occurs when the decay products have lower energy than the parent particle. The total binding energy of the daughters must be greater than the binding energy of the parent. A rough estimate for the energy released is to assume the particle splits in half. Then the energy released is
\be
Q = 2B(Z/2,A/2) - B(Z,A)
\ee
with $Z$ set to the minimum energy number of protons for the nuclei with mass number $A$. This leads to Fig. 18.2 and the fact that large $A>200$ make the best candidates for fuel, emitting up to 200 MeV of energy.

Key processes for neutrons:
\bei
\item Scattering off $^{238}U$; $\sigma\sim 10$ barns
\item destruction via absorption by $^{238}U$: $\sigma\sim 1$ barn
\item fission via $^{238}U$ capture: $\sigma\sim 10^{-5}$ barns for thermal neutrons but up to one barn for $E>1$ MeV
\item fission via $^{235}U$ capture: $\sigma\sim600$ barns for thermal neutrons
\item energy loss off moderator, governed by energy loss per collision (roughly $\xi$) and cross-section
\eei



\lsection{Fission Reactors}

Follow the neutrons: $k$ is the number of thermal neutrons generated by the previous generation of 1 thermal neutron. If $k>1$, the reactor is supercritical; if it is less than 1, it is sub-critical. The goal is to keep $k$ very close to 1; or $\rho\equiv (k-1)/k$ close to zero.

Fundamental equation
\be
k=\eta\epsilon p f
\ee
where
\bei
\item $\eta$ is the number of fast neutrons the initial thermal neutron will generate when it is captured (or causes fission)
\item $\epsilon$ is basically 1, but can be slightly larger as it counts the very few fast neutrons that cause fission (off of $^{238}U$)
\item $p$ is the probability that the neutron gets thermalized before being captured 
\item $f$ is the fraction of thermal neutrons that induce fission (some are captured by the moderator)
\eei

In a state where $k$ is close to one, the power generated by the reactor is
\be
P = E_f \frac{dN_f}{dt}
\ee
where $E_f$ is the energy released in one fission cascade ($\sim200$ MeV) and $dN_f/dT$ is the number of neutron-captured fission events per time. 

\lsection{Safety}

As a reactor heats up, the absorption cross section gets larger due to Doppler broadening. Since this is a phenomenon that leaves its imprint especially in climate physics, let's explore it in detail. Suppose the cross section for a reaction is a Dirac delta function in the energy of the neutron:
\be
\sigma_0(E) = A\delta(E-E_0)
\ee
when the absorber is at rest. But the absorbers themselves are moving with a Maxwellian distribution determined by the temperature. For simplicity, consider just one dimension. Then, the energy of the neutron in the frame of the moving absorber is 
\be
E'=\frac12\,m(v-V)^2 \simeq E_0 - mvV
\ee
assuming $v\gg V$. So, the total cross section has changed from
$\sigma_0 $
to
\be
\sigma(E) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{2\pi k_BT/M}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dV e^{-MV^2/2k_BT} \delta(E-mVv-E_0)
\ee
The delta function sets $V=\Delta E/mv$ and also brings down in the denominator a factor of $mv$, so
\be
\sigma(E)= \frac{A}{mv\sqrt{2\pi k_BT/M}} \,\exp\left\{ -\frac{M\Delta E^2}{m^2v^22k_BT} \right\}
\ee
so the cross section broadens with a width in energy of \be
\sigma_E = mv \sqrt{k_BT/M}.\ee
So, the width of the resonance scales as the square root of the temperature.

\lsection{Coriolis Force}

\bei
\item {\bf Centrifugal Force} Person on merry-go-round: from the perspective of someone standing on Earth, they are rotating with cirvular velocity $v$ at a radius $r$, so have angular frequency $\omega=v/r$. The acceleration is pointing towards the center, with a magnitude $v^2/r=r\omega^2$, so $\vec a = - \omega^2\vec r$. This is the force that needs to be exerted by the rider to keep her from falling forward. From the rider's perspective, she is stationary and exerting this force $\vec F = m\omega^2 \vec r$ to counter the fictional centrifugal force
\be
\vec F_{cent} = -m\omega^2\vec r.\ee
\item {\bf Coriolis} Fig.~\rf{coriolis} shows the basic setup. The person perceives themselves walking along the red path and getting pushed by some external force towards the center. The frequency vector is pointing out of the plane of the paper, so $\vec v\times\vec\omega$ points in the direction in the plane of the paper perpendicular to the velocity. Therefore, in the top panel, the force acts to push the walker back towards the dotted line, and in the bottom panel, the force pushes the walker towards the solid black line.
\Sfig{coriolis}{Black line shows path observed from outside observer as person walks from rim to center of rotating disk. The red shows the path taken on the disk by the walker.}

\item Use $\Delta \vec L = \vec R\times\vec F \Delta t$ to infer the magnitude of the force due to the rotation of the Earth. Assume a parcel of air, say, moves from latitude $\lambda_i$ to $\lambda_f$. Since $\vec L = m\vec R\times  \vec v$ where $\vec R$ is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation, so $R=R_\Earth\cos\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the latitude ($0$ at the equator). %For circular rotation, $\vec v= \vec\omega\times\vec r$, so the magnitude of the angular momentum is
%\be
%|L| = mR_\Earth^2\cos^2\lambda\omega_\Earth.\ee
As a parcel changes latitude by a small amount $\Delta\lambda$, the change in angular momentum is
\bea
\Delta L &=& 2mR_\Earth^2\cos\lambda\sin\lambda\omega_\Earth \Delta\lambda\vs
&=&
2mR_\Earth\cos\lambda\sin\lambda\omega_\Earth v \Delta t
\eea
forgetting about the sign, because we know that. 
The effective torque felt by the parcel is $\vec R\times\vec F$. Let's write $\vec F = A \vec v\times\vec\omega$ and try to figure out $A$. Again, just focusing on the magnitude, 
take the velocity to be towards the North in the Northern hemisphere, so $\vec v\times\vec\omega$ has magnitude $v\omega_\Earth\sin\lambda$. Therefore, $|F|=Av\omega\sin\lambda$ pointing East. The torque then has magnitude $R_\Earth F\cos\lambda$. Therefore,
\be
2mR_\Earth\cos\lambda\sin\lambda\omega_\Earth v \Delta t = R_\Earth \cos\lambda Av\omega_\Earth\sin\lambda\Delta t
.\ee
Therefore, $A=2m$ and so
\be
F_{\rm cori} = 2m\vec v\times\vec\omega_\Earth\ee
\item The Coriolis force due to the rotation of the Earth has a component perpendicular to the surface and parallel to it. The latter is
\be F_{hc} = 2m\omega_\Earth\sin\lambda \vec v\times\vec n\ee
\eei

\lsection{Surface Currents}
\bei
\item Iceberg at constant velocity at an angle to the direction of the wind.
To see this, consider Fig.~\rf{iceberg} drawn on the surface of the Earth. Since $\hat n$ is out of the paper, and the velocity is as shown, the coriolis force points downwards. Since the iceberg drifts at a constant velocity, the sum of the forces must vanish, so the force of wind must be equal and opposite to the sum of the coriolis and drag forces. This dictates the direction of the iceberg, which is clearly {\bf not} in the direction of the wind.
\Sfig{iceberg}{Forces on an iceberg drifting with constant velocity on the plane of the Earth. Since the velocity is to the East, the Coriolis force is to the south, and that combined with the drag force serve to counter the force of the wind.}
\item Now consider the coriolis force and the force of wind on a patch of water. This induces currents known as the Ekman Spiral. The equation for a patch of ocean surface is
\bea
m\vec a &=& \vec F_{\rm cor} + \vec F_{w}
\vs
&=& 2m\omega\sin\lambda \vec v\times\vec n + \vec F_{w}.
\eea
Choose the $y-$axis so it is along the direction of the wind (or simply consider what happens if the wind is blowing north). Then, the $x,y$ components are
\bea
\dot v_x &=& 2\omega\sin\lambda v_y \vs
\dot v_y &=& - 2\omega\sin\lambda v_x +\frac{F_w}{m}
\eea
Differentiate the second of these and insert the first to get
\be\ddot v_y = -\Omega^2 v_y
\ee
where $\Omega\equiv 2\omega\sin\lambda$. The solution to this is sinusoidal with a drift:
\bea
v_y &=& A\sin\Omega t\vs
v_x&=&\frac{F_w}{m\Omega} t + A\cos\Omega t\eea
I.e., apart from the drift, the current moves in a circular orbit with speed $\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}=A$ and frequency $\Omega$; the drift speed is $F_w/m\Omega$ and it is in the direction perpendicular to the wind. The uniform drift speed means that, on average, the ocean patch feels no force as the wind and Coriolis force cancel. In the Northern hemisphere, a wind blowing to the north leads to currents flowing East.
\item {\it Mass Transport:} 
E.g., winds from the north along California drive ocean water away from the coast towards the west. Deeper, colder water rises to the surface so generates the cold, foggy weather in San Francisco.

\lsection{Properties}
\lsection{Geostophic winds (Box 28.1)}
Force on a parcel of air per unit volume due to the pressure gradient is
\be
\vec f_p = -\nabla p.\ee
Here we are considering only the horizontal component of the force. This must be balanced by the coriolis force per volume
\be
\vec F_{cor} = 2\rho\omega_\Earth\sin\lambda\,\vec v\times \hat n
.\ee
So,
\be\vec v\times\hat n = \frac{\nabla p}{2\rho\omega_\Earth\sin\lambda}
.\ee
Take the cross product of both sides with $\hat n$. The left hand side then becomes $\vec v$, leading to
\be
\vec v = \frac{\hat n\times \nabla p}{2\rho\omega_\Earth\sin\lambda}.\ee
The direction of $\vec v$ for different orientations of the pressure gradient is depicted in Fig.~\rf{geo1}.
\Sfig{geo1}{In the horizontal plane, the direction of the wind velocity given the pressure gradient, using the fact that the Coriolis force balances the pressure force.}

Consider the implied wind speeds from this formula. Use $\rho_{\rm air}=1$kg/m$^3$; $\omega_\Earth= 7.3\times 10^{-5}$ Hz. For simplicity, take $\sin\lambda=1/2$. Then,
\be
v \simeq 1.4\times 10^4 \left( \frac{m^3 s}{kg}\right)\, \nabla P.\ee
Units of pressure: 1Pascal (Pa) $=0.01$millibar (mb) = kg/m/s$^2$. So, the term in parentheses is
$m^2/s/Pa$. Let's normalize the gradient to its value over 1 km; i.e, $\nabla P =\frac{\Delta P_1}{1\,km}$; then
\be
v\simeq 14 \frac{\Delta P_1}{0.01\, mb}\, m/s 
.\ee
The vertical changes in pressure are of order 30 mb/km; to get wind speeds of the proper order of magnitude, we see that the horizontal gradients must be one thousand times smaller. 
To see that this is true, look at Fig.~\rf{500_heights}.
\Spng{500_heights}{Contours showing the altitude at which the pressure is equal to 500 mb. Add an extra 0 to the height to get the result in meters.}
The horizontal pressure gradient is $dp/dx = dP/dz\, dz/dx$ and one can see that the vertical change $dz$ is of order 50 m over horizontal distances of order more than 100 km. For example, the lines labeled 546 and 552 correspond to regions where the pressure is equal to 500 mb at heights 60m apart. Yet they are separated by roughly half the width of Nebraska, so at least 100 km.

The physics behind this also makes sense. Hydrostatic equilibrium requires
\be
\frac{dP}{dz} = -g\rho = -\frac{gP}{RT}
\ee
where $R$ is mass dependent (typically inversely. proportional to the mass of the elements comprising the gas). Integrating from $z=0$ leads to
\be
z_P = \frac{R}{g} \int_{\ln P}^{\ln P_0} dx \,T
.\ee
So, the difference in heights at which the pressure reaches $P$ is determined by the logarithmic integral over the temperature. Typical temperature differences over 1000km in latitude can be 10K, or 3\%. Therefore, the height at which the pressure equals 500mb should vary by 3\% over 1000km. This corresponds to horizontal derivatives of order $15mb/1000$km or about 0.015mb/km. \comment{This should be done more carefully, deriving 3.29 in Wallace and Hobbs.}

General circulation, as described in Wallace and Hobbs 1.3.5: wind blows clockwise in the Northern hemisphere around high pressure regions. There is a high pressure max around $30^\circ$N; above this, the wind blows to the east (westerly wind) and below, winds are easterly. Winds are strongest over the ocean where there is less surface friction. So, this explains the comments above that the winds off the coast of San Francisco come from the North (Fig.~\rf{wh115}): they move clockwise around the high pressure region in the center of the Pacific and therefore on the Eastern side of the ocean, the winds are moving towards the equator at the latitude of San Francisco ($38^\circ$).
\Sjpg{wh115}{Circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. Note that the winds on the eastern side of the ocean at latitudes less than the high pressure belt at $45^\circ$ blow towards the equator, i.e., from the North. This is the cause of fog in San Francisco.}

\lsection{Fluids}

\bee
\item Continuity equation 
\item Bernoulli's Principle
\item Shear Stress: Horizontal Force (29.21)
The no-slip condition is due to molecular interactions at the surface and requires the velocity of the fluid at a surface to be at rest with respect to the surface. That leads directly to the picture in Fig. 29.9. The fluid is moving faster as you move up, so for a fixed surface at height $z$, if we take the fluid at rest, above it the fluid is moving faster, therefore dragging it forward. The force on a small element $dA$ on this surface is in the $x$-direction and proportional to both $dA$ and $\partial v_x/\partial z$. Therefore, the drag force is
\be
\frac{dF_x}{dA} = \eta \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial z}.\ee
\item Reynolds Number
\item Shear Stress: Lift (29.26)
In Fig. 29.13, the net force on the layer in the $\hat y$ (vertical) direction is 
\be
\frac{d\vec F_{lift}}{dz dx} = \hat y \left[P_--P_+\right]\ee
From Bernoulli's eqn though $P+\rho v^2/2$ is constant, so perturbing leads to
\be
P(z^+,x) + \rho v(z_+,x) v_\infty = P(z^-,x) + \rho v(z_-,x) v_\infty.\ee
Inserting that for the pressure difference leads to
\bea
\frac{d\vec F_{lift}}{dz} &=& \rho v_\infty \hat y \int_0^L dx\,\left[ v^+(x)-v^-(x)\right]\vs
&\equiv &
-\Gamma \rho v_\infty \hat y

\lsection{Simple Models}

\bei
\item incoming solar radiation: $I_\Sun$=1366 W/m$^2$
\item Earth absorbs $\pi R_\Earth^2$ of this (the cross-sectional area), so total absorbed is $I_\Sun \pi R_\Earth^2$
\item This must equal the radiation emitted from Earth: $4\pi R_\Earth^2 \sigma T_\Earth^4$, so
\item $T_\Earth=278.6K=5.43$C, not bad
\eei 

v2: not all of the radiation from the sun reaches Earth: about 6\% is absorbed by the atmosphere; clouds absorb another 14\% and the surface reflects 10\%. Technically, this is called the {\it albedo}: $a_\Earth=0.3$. Taken at face value, this reduces the total absorbed by $0.7$ and therefore the temperature is smaller by $0.7^{1/4}$, leading to a revised estimate: $T_\Earth=254K=-18$C, much worse.

v3: Account for the fact that some of the radiation emitted by Earth is reflected by the atmosphere back down to Earth, so radiative balance at the surface of the Earth leads to:
\be
4\pi R_\Earth^2 \left[ (1-a_\Earth) I_\Sun/4 + \sigma T_{atm}^4 \right]
= 4\pi R_\Earth^2 \sigma T_\Earth^4
\ee
while radiative balance in the (cartoon-version) atmosphere leads to
\be
T_\Earth^4 = 2T_{atm}^4
\ee
where the factor of 2 accounts for the radiation emitted up and down from the atmosphere. This results in
\be
T_\Earth = \left[ \frac{(1-a_\Earth) I_\Sun}{4\sigma} \big( 1-\frac12\big) \right]^{1/4} = 303K.
\ee
This is the greenhouse effect: radiation from the Earth is trapped and serves to heat it. This assumes that the atmosphere is a single layer and absorbs all of the long wavelength radiation emitted from Earth.


v4: Based on \href{https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/elementary-greenhouse.html}{The Climate Laboratory}, section 2, depicted in Fig.~\rf{2layerAtm_sketch}.
\Spng{2layerAtm_sketch}{Simple two-layer model for the temperature.}
Radiative equilibrium must hold at all 3 layers:
\bei
\item Surface: 
\be
\sigma T_s^4 = (1-\alpha) Q + \epsilon\sigma \left( T_0^4 + (1-\epsilon) T_1^4\right)\ee
where $Q$ is the sunlight absorbed on Earth $I_\Sun/4$ and $\epsilon$ is the fraction of short wavelength radiation absorbed by each layer. Note that Kirschoff's Law is used here: the emitted radiation is at the temperature of interest but suppressed by $\epsilon$. If the gas absorbs a lot at the wavelengths of interest, it also emits a lot at those wavelengths.
\item Layer 0:
\be
2\epsilon\sigma T_0^4 = \epsilon\sigma T_s^4 + \epsilon^2\sigma T_1^4\ee
\item Layer 1:
\be
2\epsilon\sigma T_1^4 = (1-\epsilon)\epsilon \sigma T_s^4 + \epsilon^2\sigma T_0^4
\ee
\eei
These are three 3 equations for 4 unknowns (taking $\alpha=0.3$. Fig.~\rf{twolayer} shows the results for the 3 temperatures as a function of the remaining free parameter $\epsilon$.
\Spng{twolayer}{Prediction of the two-layer model for the temperatures of its 3 components as a function of $\epsilon$, the fraction of long wavelength radiation absorbed by the two atmospheric layers.}
The limit $\epsilon=1$ means they absorb all the radiation so the temperatures are identical to the two-layer model in Example 34.2. The limit $\epsilon=0$ corresponds to no greenhouse effect so it recovers the prediction of v2, 254K for the surface.

The horizontal dashed lines are the observed temperatures at the surface, about 3 km up and about 10km up. Clearly, this one-parameter model is not sufficient to fit all 3 data points. Roughly the best fit is at the vertical line, $\epsilon$ a bit lower than 0.6. The temperature there is a tad lower than 300K, getting closer to truth. This model goes beyond v3 in two ways: first, by putting in a second layer, and then by allowing the opacity to drop below 100\%. 

These models are simple because (i) the radiation is not blackbody and the absorbers allow through more radiation at some wavelengths than at others and (ii) radiative transfer is not the only form of heat transfer: convection is also important. 

\lsection{1D Radiative-Convective Equilibrium}

In equilibrium the mass density $\rho$, pressure $P$, and temperature $T$ can be related to one another. In the 1D case, this become simple:
\bei
\item The upward force on a horizontal slab is $P(z)A-P(z+dz)A=-(dP/dz)A dz$. This is an upward force.This must be balanced by the force of gravity $\rho Adz g$, so
\be
dP = -\rho g dz.
\ee
\item Treating the gas as ideal leads to
\be
P=nk_BT=\frac{\rho}{m} k_BT\ee
\item Therefore,
\be
\frac{dP}{\rho} = \frac{dP k_BT}{mP} = -gdz\ee
or\be
\frac{dP}{P} = -\frac{dz}{H}
\ee
with \be
H\equiv \frac{mg}{k_BT}\ee
\item The solution is therefore
\be
P=P_0e^{-\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{H(z')}}
\ee
\eei

Taking the atmosphere to be composed of some mixture of oxygen (with 32 protons and neutrons) and nitrogen (with 28) for a compromise of 29 times the mass of the nucleon leads to $H=8.4$km at $T=290$K. If the temperature were constant, the pressure profile would look like Fig.~\rf{pressure}.
\Sfig{pressure}{Pressure profile assuming constant temperature. 290 is the surface temperature and 220 is temperature in the tropopause.}
The actual pressure follows this trend out to about 15km, where the pressure has dropped to about 100-200 mb. But it drops much faster than that at higher altitudes, so more or less moves from the blue to the orange curve.

\lsection{Convective instability}

To determine the pressure and density profile more accurately, we need to determine the temperature profile. For this, we can use the fact that the work done by the pressure of a small volume reduces the internal energy:
\be
dU = -PdV.
\ee
The internal energy drop means a drop in temperature ala $dU=c_VdT$. That is, if the actual drop in temperature is smaller than then the packet will be cooler than the surrounding air and will not rise further. 
Define the actual temperature drop to be {\it lapse rate}
\be
\Gamma \equiv -\frac{dT}{dz}.
\ee
\bee
\item If $|dT|$ from pressure differences is larger than $|\Gamma dz|$, then the packet will be cooler than the surrounding air and it will rise no further. 
\item If $|dT|$ from pressure differences is smaller than $|\Gamma dz|$, then the packet will be hotter than the surrounding air and it will continue to rise, leading to convective instability. 
\eee

The work done can be obtained by taking the differential of the ideal gas law ($PV=Nk_BT)$:
\be
PdV+dPV=Nk_BdT\ee
so
\be
c_VdT= -\left( Nk_BdT-VdP\right).
\ee
From Chapter 5 (5.32), $C_P=C_V+Nk_B$ for a monotomic ideal gas, so
\be
dT = \frac{VdP}{C_P} = \frac{ -\rho Vg dz}{C_P}
\ee
So, there will be convective instability and therefore heat propagation from lower to upper levels if
\be
\frac{ \rho Vg}{C_P} < \Gamma.
\ee
The adiabatic lapse rate \be
\Gamma_d \equiv \frac{ \rho Vg}{C_P}
\ee
is the dividing line in the temperature change: if $\Gamma>\Gamma_d$ then convection occurs until the temperature gradient drops down to $\Gamma_d$. If $\Gamma< \Gamma_d$, then there is no convection.

Near the Earth's surface, we can compute $\Gamma_d$ using the fact that $c_P=C_P/\rho V=1$ kJ/kg-K. We find $\Gamma_d=9.8$ K/km. It might be interesting to compare this to the very simple v3 model above, where the temperature in the ``atmosphere'' was $2^{1/4}=1.19$ smaller than that on Earth. In that model, that means a difference: 
\be
\Delta T = 303\left(1-\frac{1}{1.19}\right)= 48K.\ee
So depending on where you put the top of the atmosphere in that simple model (somewhere between the tropopause at 20km and the stratosphere at 40km), it seems clear that the lapse rate will be roughly of order the adiabatic lapse rate, so convection will play some role.

\newcommand\ipcc[1]{{\tt IPCC Report: #1}}

\lsection{Radiative Forcing}

This is defined to be: ``The change in net irradiance (down -up) at the tropopause after allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, but with surface and tropospheric temperatures and state held fixed at the unperturbed values.'' 

\example{If the albedo changes from 0.1 to 0.11; this means that an additional one percent of solar radiation is reflected back to space instead of absorbed. Since the total flux hitting Earth is about $341\times(1-0.21)$ W/m$^2$, where the 0.21 is the albedo due to the atmosphere and clouds; i.e., stuff that stops the solar flux from hitting Earth. Hence, the change in the Earth's albedo by 0.01 would reflect back an additional $0.01*.79*341=2.7$ W/m$^2$. So the forcing would be -2.7 W/m$^2$. Note that estimates for this vary, from Example 34.3, which I don't understand, to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing}{the wikipedia article} that goes much lower.}

\example{Box 34.2: Clouds are the hard problem. Thet reflect light with the solar spectrum with an albedo of 0.13, leading to upward forcing of $0.13\times1366/4=44$ W/m$^2$. But they also reflect infrared radiation from Earth back to the surface; the estimate the book gives is 31, so the net forcing would be -13W/m$^2$. This mean that if the cloud cover were to increase by a percent, the forcing would be quite small.}

\ipcc{A.4.1: Human caused radiative forcing of $2.72\pm 0.76$ W/m$^2$ in 2019 relative to 1750.}

Some facts:
\bee
\item Human emit 10 GT of carbon every year (Fig~\rf{emissions}). This is often reported in units of parts per million. The conversion factor is
\be
1 {\rm ppm} =2.13 \,{\rm Tonnes\, of\, Carbon}.
\ee
The total amount of air in the atmosphere is about 5.15 quadrillion tonnes $=5.15\times 10^{18}$ kg. One part per million means that the number density of $CO_2$ particle is a millionth of the total density. Since the mass of carbon in $CO_2$ compared to the average mass ($N_2$ (78\%) and $O_2$ (21\%)) is $12/29$, 1 ppm is equivalent to 0.414ppmm (of Carbon, not $CO_2$), where the last 'm' stands for mass. This means that 1 ppm corresponds to $2.13\times10^{12}$ kg of $CO_2$. That in turn corresponds to $2.13$ Gigatonnes, since 1 tonne is equal to 1000 kg.
\Spng{emissions}{Global Annual CO$_2$ emissions in tons of carbon.}
\item This has led to an increase of 400 GTC since pre-industrial but only half of that remains in the atmosphere with the other half going into the ocean (see Figs.~\rf{cum} and \rf{co2}).
\Spng{cum}{Cumulative global emissions. Note that about half of this stays in the atmosphere.}
The bottom line though is that there is now 900 GTC in the atmosphere, corresponding to 420ppm.
\Spng{co2}{Measured CO$_2$ in the atmosphere in units of tons of carbon. There is more CO2 in the atmosphere in Northern Spring and less in the Fall. This reflects the fact that throughout the winter the plants are decaying and returning CO2 to the atmosphere. Then in the Spring, the plants start recapturing the CO2 to grow so that by Fall the atmospheric CO2 is a minimum.}
\item According to 34.37, this corresponds to a forcing of about 2W/m$^2$. The underlying physics here is that the absorption cross section for $CO_2$ decays exponentially away from the central wavelength of 15 $\mu$m. There are several reasons for this broadening: thermal broadening, which we covered in nuclear physics, the intrinsic line width of the cross section, which is due to quantum mechanics, and the actual culprit here: what is called {\it pressure-broadening}. This is the hardest of the three to understand. \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aabac6#daabac6eqn037}{This article} has a nice treatment of the full effect.
\item Without feedbacks, since $\lambda_0=-3.2$ W/m$^2$ K (34.32), the temperature increase due to this amount of carbon would be 0.6K. The blackbody version of this is to compute the forcing due to a temperature in the change of the Earth with everything else held fixed. A positive temperature change $\Delta T$ would lead to a larger upward (hence negative) flux via
\be
F = -4\sigma T^3 \Delta T = -4\times 5.67\times 10^{-8} \times 288^3 \times \frac{\Delta T}{K} \,W/m^2\eql{upward}\ee
or
$F=-5.4 (\Delta T/K) W/m^2$.However, the Earth's radiation does reach the tropopause cleanly. Rather with ``the state held fixed,'' quite a bit of the Earth's radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere. Therefore, a change in the Earth's temperature by $\Delta T$ would lead to a smaller upward flux than predicted by \ec{upward}. The book uses the heuristic that on average across wavelengths the radiation that reaches the tropopause comes from a height such that the atmosphere is about 255K, and that reduces the above estimate to 3.76 W/m$^2$ for each $\Delta T/K$. But this seems misleading. 
\item There are feedbacks, the most important of which is that warmer air can hold more water vapor, which itself absorbs a lot more IR radiation. This roughly doubles the predicted rise in temperature.
\eee

Radiation:
\bee
\item Optical depth less than one can be handled with an emissivity less than one as above. So, increase the amount of absorber would just reduce the amount of IR radiation linearly with the density
\item An optically thick absorber like CO$_2$ is more complicated. There is the exponential suppression in the wings that leads to a logarithmic dependence on the density.
\item Even in the trough though, the emissions in that band would come from higher up in the atmosphere so -- keeping the emission temperature fixed and the lapse rate fixed -- leads to a higher surface temperature.
