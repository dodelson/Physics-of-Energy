{\bf Midterm, Physics of Energy 33-226}
\end{centering}
There are 5 problems in total. Each of the 5 problems is worth the same number of points.

%\begin{enumerate}

%\problem{Problem 2.1 in the book}

\problem{1. \Sfig{sh1}{Heat capacity in units of $Nk_B$ for a given diatomic molecule.}
\bee
\item Why is the value at very low temperature equal to 1.5?
\textcolor{blue}{At low temperature only translational degrees of freedom are excited. There are 3 of those, one for each direction, and they each contribute $Nk_B/2$ to the heat capacity.}
\item Why does it rise to 2.5 at higher temperatures?
\textcolor{blue}{Two additional degrees of freedom, rotational modes, become accessible.}
\item Why does it rise to 3.5 at the highest temperature?
\textcolor{blue}{Two additional degrees of freedom, vibrational modes, become accessible.}
\item From this graph, estimate the value of the first excited rotational state of the molecule (in J).
\textcolor{blue}{It looks like there is enough energy for the first excited rotational state to get populated when $T\sim 20$K; this corresponds to an energy of $k_BT=2.8\times 10^{-22}$J.}
\item Estimate the ground state vibrational energy (in J).
\textcolor{blue}{It looks like there is enough energy for the first excited vibrational state to get populated when $T\sim 2000$K; this corresponds to an energy of $k_BT=2.8\times 10^{-20}$J. The energy required to excited a molecule into the first excited state is $\hbar \omega$. The ground state energy is half of this, so an estimate for the ground state energy is $1.4\times 10^{-20}$J.}
\eee}

\problem{2. In class, we found that equating the radiation coming in from the Sun and the radiation leaving the Earth led -- under simplifying conditions -- to a temperature on Earth of 291K. That calculation assumed that the Earth absorbed {\it all} of the incoming radiation.
How would the temperature change if we accounted for the fact that ice on Earth reflects back 10\% of the incoming solar radiation?

\textcolor{blue}{The flux from the Sun that is absorbed by the Earth is 10\% less than in our previous analysis. Therefore, the flux from Earth should be 10\% lower so that balance is maintained. The flux is proportional to $T_\Earth^4$, so the new temperature should lower by $0.9^{1/4}=0.974$. Multiplying this by the given estimate of 291K leads to a new estimate of 283K.}
}


\problem{3. Suppose that the temperature of the water in the ocean at a particular place is 30$^\circ$C from the surface down to 100m, and then below that the temperature decreases at a constant rate until it reaches 5$^\circ$C at a depth of 1000m. The thermal conductivity of seawater is $k=0.60$W/m/K; its heat capacity is $C=4$kJ/kg/K; and its density is $10^3$kg/m$^3$.
\bee
\item What is the heat flux downwards between 100 and 1000m? 

\textcolor{blue}{$q=k\Delta T/L$; here $\Delta T=25K$ and $L=900$m, so using the value of $k$ leads to a heat flux of 0.0167W/m$^2$.}

\item All water below 1000m is at the same temperature for a variety of reasons not of interest here. At the rate of heat flux calculated in A, how long would it take to heat a column of water in the ocean from 1000m down to 2000m by 5$^\circ$C? 

\textcolor{blue}{The mass per area of the water in this region is $10^3$kg/m$^3 \times 1000m = 10^6$kg/m$^2$. This is heated at a rate of 0.0167W/m$^2$. To raise the temperature by $5$K requires $Q=(cM)\times 5K = 20kJ M/kg$. Using the mass per area, we require $20kJ \times 10^6/m^2=2\times 10^{10}J/m^2$. Energy is coming in at the rate of $0.0167 J/m^2$/sec. Dividing by this rate leads to a time of $1.2\times 10^{12}$s = 40,000 years.}
\eee}

\problem{4. Fig.~\rf{co2ppm} shows that the amount of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere in 2020 was about 420 ppm, so that for every million molecules in the atmosphere, there were 420 $CO_2$ molecules. Take the density of molecules in the atmosphere to depend only on the distance from the surface of the Earth, $z$:
\be
n(z) = n_0 e^{-z/H}\ee
where $H=8.5$km, and $n_0=2.5\times 10^{25}$ air molecules per $m^3$.
\Sjpeg{co2ppm}{Fraction of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere as a function of time. The units are parts per million: the number of $CO_2$ molecules as a fraction of all the molecules in the atmosphere.}
\bee
%\item What is the mass of one $CO_2$ molecule in kg?

\item How many $CO_2$ molecules are in 1 GtC (Gigatonnes of carbon)?

\textcolor{blue}{1Gtonne is $10^{12}$ kg. Each $CO_2$ molecule contains $1.67\times 10^{-27}\times 12=2\times 10^{-26}$ kg of carbon. So it takes $5\times 10^{37}$ molecules to get 1 GtC.}

\item What is the total number of air molecules in the atmosphere?

\textcolor{blue}{We are given the density; we must integrate this over the volume. But the volume decomposes into the surface area of Earth ($4\pi R_\Earth^2$) times the integral over the height:
\be
\int_0^\infty dz e^{-z/H} n_0= n_0H.\ee
So the total number of molecules is $2.5\times 10^{25}\times 4\pi R_\Earth^2\times 8.5\times 10^3m=1.1\times 10^{44}$.
Slightly more formally, the total number of molecules is (using $r-R_\Earth$ instead of $z$ to indicate distance from the surface of the Earth)
\be
\int_{r>R_\Earth} dV n(r-R_\Earth) = 4\pi \int_{R_{\Earth}}^\infty dr r^2 n(r-R_\Earth)
\ee
where the $4\pi$ comes from the angular integral. Now $n$ is peaked so close to the surface of the earth that the factor of $r^2$ in the integrand can be set equal to $R_\Earth^2$ and removed from the integral (you could actually do the integral and you would get corrections of order $H/R_\Earth$, which are of order $10^{-5}$. Then we have
\be
4\pi R_\Earth^2 n_0 \int_{0}^\infty dz e^{-z/H} = 4\pi R_\Earth^2 n_0H.
\ee
}

\item Use your answer from A and B to convert 420 ppm into GtC .

\textcolor{blue}{The number of $CO_2$ molecules is $4.2\times 10^{-4}\times 1.1\times 10^{44}=4.6\times 10^{40}$. The mass of carbon these, using A, is 924 Gt.}
\eee
}


\problem{5. We have several times assumed that the pressure in the atmosphere $P=P_0e^{-z/H}$ with $H=8.5$km. Use this and also assume the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium (\ec{hydro}) and is an ideal gas with constant composition of 80\% nitrogen ($N_2$) and 20\% oxygen ($O_2$). Show that the temperature is constant with height. What is the temperature?}

\textcolor{blue}{The equilibrium equation says that
\be
\frac{dP}{dz} = -\rho g = - \frac{Pm_{air}g}{k_BT}
\ee
where the second equality uses the fact that the mass density $\rho$ is equal to the number of air molecules, the $N$ in the ideal gas formula, multiplied by the mass of each molecule. Given the pressure profile in the problem, $dP/dz = -P/H$, so
\be
-\frac{P}H = - \frac{Pm_{air}g}{k_BT}\ee
or
\be T = \frac{m_{air}gH}{k_B}.\ee
Taking the mass of an air molecule to be $1.67\times 10^{-27}\times [.8\times 28+.2\times 32]=4.8\times 10^{-26}$kg leads to $T=290$K.
Note that there is beauty here: multiplying by $k_B$ leads to an equality between }
