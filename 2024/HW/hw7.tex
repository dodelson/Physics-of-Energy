%\problem{Problem 2.1 in the book}

\problem{Problem 27.2}
\problem{Problem 27.7; consider only the horizontal displacement because the vertical displacement is much smaller than that due to gravity. Also, although the book doesn't say this, sportscasters\footnote{Actually, the quote is sometimes attributed to Branch Rickey, who is best known for hiring Jackie Robinson to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers. My mother grew up in Brooklyn idolizing both of them and I followed suit. Jackie Robinson is a true American hero. Branch Rickey is extremely interesting in his own right. My favorite quote of his (which will resonate with those of you who have read about Mr. Dean) is ``I'm a man of some intelligence. I've had some education, passed the bar, practiced law. I've been a teacher and I deal with men of substance; statesmen, business leaders, the clergy... So why do I spend my time arguing with Dizzy Dean?'' This aside is mainly intended to show you how easy it is to use footnotes in latex.} often say that ``Baseball is a game of inches.'' If that were true, would the coriolis force be a relevant factor in baseball?}
\problem{Problem 27.9. The rate of mass upwelling should be expressed in units of kg/m/s. It is calculated by assuming that water from levels below 50m replace the water in the top 50 m that moved away at the drift velocity you have computed.}
